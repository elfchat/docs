# Installation

## Upload

Upload the contents of the archive with chat on your server (for example, in folder `/home/domain.com/chat/`).
Now we need to check that folders `app/open`, `upload` were available for writing.

> Usually these folders give write permission 777 : `chmod-R 777 app/open upload`

## Configuration

Open chat in browser (for example : `http://domain.com/chat/`) and you will be taken to a page that verify requirements of chat (`http://domain.com/chat/web/check.php`).

If there are any errors, correct them before continuing.

If no error was detected, click `Install`. Follow the installer instructions.

Done! Chat installed.
